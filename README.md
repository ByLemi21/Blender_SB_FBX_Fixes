Modified Blender FBX Addon for Blender 4.4 that has a new setting for fixing the inverted bones from Stellar Blade.

To install, replace the contents of `Blender\4.4\scripts\addons_core\io_scene_fbx` with the contents of the `io_scene_fbx` folder in this repository.

Huge thanks to: 
Salt (Providing a list with the inverted bones)
Njaecha (Code optimization and managing the github files)
